The language will be english, the event will take two hours. The selected date/time will be communicated.

You will not be required to speak up at all but if you want to, and the audience wants to listen, you will get the opportunity: As usual for barcamps, the first agenda item is the estabilshment of an agenda, i.e. all participants will be asked if they wish to contribute a session, and the audience will vote which sessions will be hold. You will be able to offer -or ask for- convetional speeches, workshops or problem-solving workshops ("can someone please explain to me how...").

You will need a audio connection (headset recommended). You can but you are not required to open your webcam. A Chromium-based browser like Chrome or Edge Chromium is recommended in case you want to share your screen.
